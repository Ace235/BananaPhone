       <h1> Yoselin Moreno </h1>
       
       <p>  My name is Yoselin Moreno, I’m 19 years old and I'm a first generation college student at the University of Memphis. I was born and raised in Memphis so deciding to go to the University of Memphis after high school was a no-brainer. At the UofM I'm majoring in both Journalism with a concentration in Creative Mass Media and Spanish. Like many other college students CMM wasn’t the major I originally had chosen however I'm so glad to have found it. After college I hope to eventually work for myself as a content creator for other myself and other brands. At the moment I am both a student and working two part-time jobs. I am also a photographer in the Memphis area photographing events, weddings and portrait year round. I am also a huge film nerd and love to spend my free time watching all types of films. </p>
