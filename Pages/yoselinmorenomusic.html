                 <p> Music is truly something I can't live without. I love music more than anything. I love any type of genre weather it's pop, rock, or country, However more than an anything I live indie pop music. There's something about indie pop music that just makes you feel like you are the main chatacter in a film and I love that feeling. Some of my favorite indie bands include Coin, Bleachers, Badsuns, and Hippo Campus. Some of my favorite albums also happen to by these bands. These albums include : Coin, Strange desire, and Landmark.
