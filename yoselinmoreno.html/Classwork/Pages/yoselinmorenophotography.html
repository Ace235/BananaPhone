          <h1>  Photography </h1> 
          
          <p> I have loved photography for as long as I can remember. When I was 16 I saved up all the money I had earned working my part-time job and bought myself my first camera. It was honestly one of the happiest days of my life and I can't imagine my life with out a camera. I am 20 now and after four years of expierence I still find myself learning new thing all the time about photography. I have also gotten the chance to explore different type of photography. This includes portrait, events, and product photography.  Out of all these types my favorite type of photography to do has to be portrait photography. I always love working with new people and getting the chance to see them through my lens.
